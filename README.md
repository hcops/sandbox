# Developer Workplace

Managing a homogeneous development environment on local desktops ensures consistency, reduces configuration issues, and streamlines the development process. Combining the nix package manager with git repositories allows for a management of local environments through configuration files. It ensure that all team members use the same configuration, tracks change and allows rollback without abstraction of the runtime environment.

## 1. Linux Developer Environment

ChromeOS allows DevOps engineers to run a secure [Linux sandbox](https://chromeos.dev/en/linux), which minimizes security risks is easy to set up and suitable for development needs that address Linux as a main host operating system.

## 2. Nix Packetmanager

The [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/) allows engineers to build and manage software packages. It enables functional deployments and provides features like reproducibility, isolation, and atomic upgrades. Key features is ensuring that a package is built in the same way every time, regardless of the environment, which is achieved through precise specification of dependencies and build instructions.

```sh
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon --yes
```
## 3. Home-Manager Repository

Use `gh` nix package to clone the github repository

```sh
nix-shell -p gh
```

Log into github

```sh
gh auth login
```

Clone home manager repository

```sh
gh repo clone torstenboettjer/home_manager
```

## 4. Experimental Features

Enabling flakes requires to enable experimental features by appending the following line to `/etc/nix/nix.conf`:

```sh
echo -e "experimental-features = nix-command flakes\ntrusted-users = root torsten" | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.conf
```

Run functional test

```sh
nix run nixpkgs#hello
```

## 5. Home-Manager Channel

Add and than update the appropriate channel, e.g. to follow the Nixpkgs master channel run:

```sh
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager
nix-channel --update
```

## 6. Installation

Create the first home-manager generation

```sh
nix-shell '<home-manager>' -A install
```

Add the nix path to `.bashrc`

```sh
echo -e '. "$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh"' >> $HOME/.profile
```

Test the installation

```sh
source $HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh
home-manager --version
```

Make sure that the right system is active in *~/home_manager/flake.nix*

```nix
  outputs = { nixpkgs, home-manager, ... }:
    let
      lib = nixpkgs.lib;
      # system = "x86_64-linux";
      system = "aarch64-linux";
```

Link the home manager configruation files to the repository

```sh
rm ~/.config/home-manager/home.nix ~/.config/home-manager/flake.nix
for file in home.nix flake.nix; do ln -s "$HOME/home_manager/$file" "$HOME/.config/home-manager/$file"; done
```

Run the Makefile to update the minimal configuration

```sh
cd ~/home_manager
make update
```

Activating direnv, an environment switcher for the shell that automatically loads and unloads environment variables, when the directory is changed

```sh
echo -e 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

## 7. Development Environments

Devenv is a tool that leverages Nix to create reproducible development environments, it is an extension of the Nix ecosystem, tailored for development workflows. A development environment is defined by creating a directory, setting up a git repository, and sharing the repository with other developers via Github.

```sh
devenv init
```

Will create the following files{subdirectories in a given repository: `.envrc, devenv.nix, devenv.yaml, .gitignore`. The nix file contains the system software and platform components, required to build an applications.
